# TraDE-OPT workshop on Algorithmic and Continuous Optimization: Implementation of a solver in Julia / Introduction to JuMP

In this session you will implement a solver in Julia as well as its MathOptInterface in order to make it available through JuMP.
A skeleton code will be provided so that the task is doable during the time of the session.
No prior knowledge in Julia, JuMP or MathOptInterface is required.

Requirements:

* A laptop.
* Julia v1.6 or v1.7.
* An editor of Julia scripts (e.g. [Julia in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/julia)) or Jupyter notebooks with [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl).
